This is the first project listed in the _'Build 25 React Projects – Tutorial'_ by _FreeCodeCamp_. 

## What I learnt
- I learnt core fundamentals on the `useState` feature.
- I was able to extract data from a `data.js` file and display it on my UI.
- I learnt how to use `className` to link a `.css` file and add styling elements to the app.

# 01 - Accordion

This is the first project listed in the _'Build 25 React Projects – Tutorial'_ by _FreeCodeCamp_. 

## What I learnt
- I learnt core fundamentals on the `useState` feature.
- I was able to extract data from a `data.js` file and display it on my UI.
- I learnt how to use `className` to link a `.css` file and add styling elements to the app.

## Version 1.00 (Current) - Demo

## How can I make this better 
- Currently, the animations are not as smooth, so that could be done better.
- Stylistically, I could make the answers stand out from the questions.
- The menu is only able to select one item at at a time, We could expand this to display any number of documents, so I am really looking forward to implementing that...

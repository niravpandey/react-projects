# React Projects

*React Projects* is a collection that documents my journey as I explore the fundamental concepts of Front-End Development using React. I chose to add React to my skill set because it helps me build interactive, dynamic applications that users can see and engage with directly. The ability to create usable, consumer-facing software is a highly valuable skill, and it was a key motivator for me to start working with React.

In the future, I aim to create interactive experiences that combine my expertise in Python and Data Science with React. 

## My Plan Ahead - 31/03/2024

- **Project Frequency**: 1 project per week
- **Complete**: "Build 25 React Projects â€“ Tutorial" by _FreeCodeCamp_
- **Create**: At least 5 unique projects that align with my interests, including data visualization tools and interactive apps
